  - name: "First Generation (Fourth-generation Santa Fe platform)"
    start_year: 2020
    end_year: 2023
    description: "The original Santa Fe Hybrid was based on the facelifted fourth-generation Santa Fe platform, introduced as part of Hyundai's broader electrification strategy. Visually identical to the conventional Santa Fe except for hybrid badging, it featured the bold front fascia with distinctive T-shaped LED daytime running lights and a wide cascading grille that characterized the mid-cycle refresh. Powered by a hybrid system combining a 1.6L turbocharged four-cylinder engine with a 44 kW electric motor and 1.49 kWh lithium-ion battery pack, producing a combined 226 HP and 258 lb-ft of torque. Power was delivered through a six-speed automatic transmission specifically designed for hybrid applications, available with either front-wheel drive or HTRAC all-wheel drive. The interior matched the premium appointments of the standard Santa Fe, featuring an available 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system, 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, and Hyundai's comprehensive SmartSense safety suite. Offering approximately 30-40% better fuel efficiency than the conventional gasoline models, it maintained full five-passenger seating capacity without compromising interior space due to the compact battery placement. This generation established the hybrid powertrain as a significant option in the Santa Fe lineup, particularly appealing to buyers seeking improved efficiency without the range limitations or charging requirements of a fully electric vehicle."

    description: "The current Santa Fe Hybrid is built on the fifth-generation Santa Fe platform, sharing its dramatic redesign featuring a boxy, upright silhouette inspired by more traditional SUVs rather than the crossover styling of its predecessor. Distinguished by an H-shaped lighting signature, squared-off profile, and prominent body cladding, it maintains the bold styling direction of the conventional model. The hybrid powertrain has been updated but follows a similar concept, combining a 1.6L turbocharged four-cylinder engine with a more powerful electric motor and larger lithium-ion battery, producing a combined output of approximately 231 HP. The six-speed automatic transmission has been refined for improved efficiency and response, available with either front-wheel drive or HTRAC all-wheel drive systems. The interior features the same major advancements as the standard model, with dual 12.3-inch screens, horizontal dashboard design, and bridge-type center console creating an open, spacious feeling. Available in six or seven-seat configurations, it maintains the innovative folding rear seats that create a fully flat load floor when needed. Fuel efficiency remains a key selling point, with combined ratings significantly better than non-hybrid competitors while maintaining full SUV capability. This generation positions the Santa Fe Hybrid as a more adventure-focused vehicle with greater emphasis on utility and outdoor lifestyle use, while delivering the efficiency benefits of electrification without compromising on space, capability, or features."
